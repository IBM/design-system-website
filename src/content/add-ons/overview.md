**_Add-ons_ are components built specifically for IBM Cloud products and experiences. Carbon supports two main libraries, [Vanilla.js](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components) and [React](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react). There is also an unofficial [Angular library](https://pages.github.ibm.com/adaniel/angular-carbon-components/) for Carbon Components that is managed by an external team.**
