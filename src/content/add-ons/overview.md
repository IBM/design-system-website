**_Add-ons_ are components that are specifically built for IBM Cloud products and experiences.**


## Carbon ecosystem
Carbon supports two main libraries, [Vanilla.js](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components) and [React](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react). There is also an unofficial Angular library for Carbon Components that is managed by an external team.
