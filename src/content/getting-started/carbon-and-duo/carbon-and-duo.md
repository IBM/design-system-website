## The Duo transition

Duo—the all-new IBM Design Language—is coming to Carbon. It represents a completely fresh approach to the design of all things at IBM.

The Carbon team will be introducing the new Duo components and guidelines incrementally into the Carbon Design System over the next few months. You’ll notice new entries marked “experimental” being added all the time. Experimental components are not fully tested and/or vetted, but are available for designers to work with. Your feedback on these components is critical for the success of Carbon; please open a github issue from the footer of any page on the Carbon site to let the team know what you think. 

###FAQ

**What is the difference between Duo and Carbon?**

Carbon is the design system that powers many of IBM’s most successful digital products. Duo is the new redesign of the IBM Design Language which will define and guide everything designed by IBM, including software products, digital and traditional marketing, hardware, advertising, events, physical spaces, and more. Think of Carbon as the “digital manifestation” of the Design Language.    

**How do I ensure that my products are “Duo-ready”?**

Keep building with Carbon! The best way to ensure a smooth transition as Duo comes online is to adhere to the Carbon guidelines, elements and components. 

**How will teams adopt Duo?**
   
The IBM Design core team will be establishing an adoption and activation program for teams who will be working with Duo. Teams will receive either in-person or remote Duo training and activation before the first version of the new design system is externally released. As we have more details about the program, we will share news on Slack, Connections, and in the IBM Design Town Hall.
