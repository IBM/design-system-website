## The Duo transition

Duo—the all-new IBM Design Language—is coming to Carbon. It represents a completely fresh approach to the design of all things IBM.

The Carbon team will be incrementally introducing the new Duo components and guidelines into the Carbon Design System over the next few months. You’ll notice new entries marked “experimental” being added all the time. Experimental components are not fully tested and/or vetted, but are available for designers to work with. Your feedback on these components is critical for the success of Carbon; please open a github issue from the footer of any page on the Carbon site to let the team know what you think.
