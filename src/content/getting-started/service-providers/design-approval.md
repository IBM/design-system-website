## Design approval


### Baseline requirements
Services must meet the following baseline requirements in order to qualify for Experimental approval and beyond. See the [General tab](/getting-started/service-providers/general) for details on each capability:

- [ ] Utilize Resource Controller (RC)
- [ ] Develop your service as a microservice
- [ ] Utilize IAM to grant and enforce access to your service
- [ ] Bill customers through BSS
- [ ] Employ IBM Cloud platform Metering
- [ ] Index your resource utilizing GhoST
- [ ] Ensure your service is Global Catalog compliant
- [ ] Follow IBM Cloud platform UI behaviors, especially:
  - [ ] Do not launch out to new a browser window or tab to work with your resource
  - [ ] Use Carbon components to build your UI


### Experimental
- [ ] Download the [Journey map kit](http://journey-map.stage1.mybluemix.net/#) and complete an as-is journey of your service.
- [ ] Schedule a live walk-through with your assigned design Cloud focal in staging of your product from discovery, to implementation, to usage.

### Beta
- [ ] Enable NPS for your service in staging.
- [ ] Complete five user tests while your service is in Beta. Refer to these [user testing guidelines](https://ibm.ent.box.com/notes/136934943258) to help you choose and conduct tests.
- [ ] Conduct a live walk-through in staging of your product from discovery, to implementation, to usage with your assigned design Cloud focal.

### GA
- [ ] Service provider agrees to maintain and support the offering. Additional functionality and major design changes will be subject to a design review with your assigned design Cloud focal.
- [ ] Demonstrate NPS is enabled for your service.
- [ ] Present your current NPS data at the Tuesday Cloud Platform Playback.
- [ ] Conduct a live walk-through of your product from discovery, to implementation, to usage with your assigned design Cloud focal.

### Iterations
- [ ] Use Optimizely, an A/B testing tool, to validate future iterations in production. Follow [these instructions](https://pages.github.ibm.com/Bluemix/platform-analytics/tools/optimizely/) to apply for access, receive training, and to get started with the tool.  
- [ ] Demonstrate NPS is enabled for your service.
