Common actions are frequently used actions that appear multiple times across different components and workflows. For platform consistency, these actions should only be applied in the ways described below.

## Regressive actions

### Cancel
Cancel stops the current action and closes the component or item. The user should be warned of any possible negative consequences of stopping an action from progressing, such as data corruption or data loss. [View in glossary](http://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/glossary#cancel)
