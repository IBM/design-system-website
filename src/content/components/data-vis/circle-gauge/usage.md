## General guidelines

Gauge graphs show the part-to-whole relationship of one value compared to its total. The gauge moves clockwise or counterclockwise depending on its content. When a value is expressing the amount used out of a total, the gauge will start empty and fill-in clockwise. In contrast, if a value is showing the amount remaining out of a total, the gauge will start full then empty counterclockwise.
