### Definition Tooltip
The primary purpose of a Definition Tooltip is to provide additional help or context to an item. Their primary use case is for defining terms, such as within a Form where the label needs an additional definition. They can also be used to define an icon button. We recommend Definition Tooltips contain read-only text that is kept to a minimum. These Tooltips appear on `hover`. If you need to include other components within a Tooltip, refer to the Interactive Tooltip below.

### Interactive Tooltip
Interactive Tooltips can contain text and other interactive elements such as a Button or a Link. They should only appear on mouse `click`, due to the fact that there are multiple click targets within the Tooltip.
