## Blind Users

### How they experience and interface
- Uses a **screen reader** and **keyboard** to experience interfaces
- Relies on spoken or Braille output
- Does not use a pointer or mouse for input

### What designers should think about
- How is visual information translated into text?
- Consider what non-textual information **sounds like** to a user

<div id='low-vision'></div>
## Low Vision

Low vision can include partial sight in one or both eyes, and range from mild to severe. It affects 246 million people, or about 4% of the worldâ€™s population.

### How they experience and interface
- May use **screen readers**, **screen magnifiers** and **high contrast modes** to experience interfaces
- High contrast users may rely on a **monochrome display**
- Low vision users may be using a **screen reader** to preview your website or experience
- Some users with low vision may not use adaptive technology for a variety of reasons

### What designers should think about
- Designers should be concerned with the **readability** and **visual clarity** of content.
- Consider how relative proximity of information changes when a page is magnified.
- Ensure you're following [keyboard guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/keyboard-accessibility/) to ensure the page is read to the user in a logical order.
- Consider the experience of a low vision user trying to use a product without adaptive technologies.
- To get an understanding of the various low vision disabilities, we recommend using the [NoCoffee](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nocoffee/jjeeggmbnhckmgdhmgdckeigabjfbddl) Chrome plugin to preview websites.
- Use Carbon components. **Carbon components meet WCAG - AA contrast standards across our entire system.** You can read more and view the entire guidelines for [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) on their website.

### How does this apply to everyone?
- Users without disabilities sometimes need to view screens in situations that make contrast important. For example, imagine using a screen outside on a bright day.

<div id='deaf'></div>
## Deaf and Hard of Hearing

### How they experience and interface
- Users who are deaf or hard of hearing rely on captioning and other alternative representations of audio.

### What designers should think about
- Designers should find alternatives to conveying information exclusively with sound.
- Caption and transcribe all videos and animations that have meaningful audio.

### How does this apply to everyone?
- All users can benefit from closed captioning. Imagine using your device in a loud environment or, alternatively, in a quiet environment when it wouldn't be appropriate to turn your sound on.

<div id='physical'></div>
## Physical Disabilities

### How they experience an interface
- Users with physical disabilities may rely on keyboards, track balls, voice recognition and other assistive technologies to interact with an interface.

### What designers should think about
- Designers should be laser-focused on keyboard interaction, making sure all interactions are keyboard accessible and efficient.
- Learn how to navigate using a [keyboard](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/keyboard-nav.html.en) and spend one day navigating the web, email, and digital products using only keyboard.

### How does this apply to everyone?
- Many "super users" prefer to navigate using keyboards because it is quicker. Good Keyboard Navigation helps everyone be more productive.

<div id='color'></div>
## Colorblindness

Colorblindness affects 8% of all men and 0.4% of women.

### How they experience an interface
- Color blind users will not be able to differentiate between some colors on an interface.

### What designers should think about
- Run your design through a color blind simulator. If you're working in Sketch, we recommend the [Stark](http://www.getstark.co/) plugin.
- To view best practices for using color in Data Visualization, view the [Data Vis](/data-vis/overview/colors) color page.

<div id='cognitive'></div>
## Cognitive Disabilities
Users with cognitive disabilities offer a broad spectrum of concerns for design. The causes of disability may vary so it's best to focus on the functional Cognitive disabilities which can include difficulty with:
- Memory
- Problem-solving
- Attention
- Reading, linguistic, and verbal comprehension
- Math comprehension
- Visual comprehension

### How they experience an interface
- May have limited working memory and need information to remain visible so they can access it when needed.
- May experience seizures when exposed to flashing content.

### What designers should think about
- Designers should understand the danger of **flashing content, complex language, non-stopping animations** and **fundamental cognitive usability heuristics.**
- Design in as linear a fashion as possible and focus on design heuristics that have to do with **cognitive load and memory.**

### How does this affect everyone
- Following guidelines for cognitive disabilities helps everyone. Busy environments can tax your cognitive load. Aging adults may also experience a decline in cognitive abilities. Placing a low cognitive load on users reduces mistakes and improves effectiveness, regardless of their abilities.
