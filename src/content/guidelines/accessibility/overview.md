**Web and software experiences should be accessible for everyone, regardless of a person's abilities or impairments. It's not just the law, it's the right thing to do. Read on to learn what you can do to make IBM products accessible to all.**



## Carbon and Accessibility

Carbon is committed to following and complying with best practices when it comes to accessibility. The Carbon team has done extensive research and testing to make sure our components follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and meet AA standards. Our patterns are perceivable, operable, and understandable to users, even when using a screen reader or other assistive technology.

However, _how you use Carbon_ also affects the accessibility of a product. Read this page to learn about accessibility in general. Then, while you're working, use the role specific, Carbon accessibility guidelines to help you make products that anyone can use.

## What does it mean for a product to be accessible?

Accessible products:

- Give everyone the same benefits regardless of disabilities a user may have
- Can adapt to any user in any context.

Disabilities are a mismatch between one's ability and one's environment. They can be:

|               |                 |
|-------------  | ----------------|  
| Situational   |     A person with typical vision might struggle to view their screen in a bright environment. Or, a person sitting in a library may be unable to watch a video with the audio turned on. |
| Temporary     |     A person with a broken wrist may not be able to type but will regain the ability when healed.      |
| Long Lasting  |     This is what people typically think of when they hear "disability" and includes the categories listed below.   |

Accessible design is not exclusively for a fixed subset of users. When we design for people with disabilities, _we are designing for everyone in every situation._

## Global Accessibility Standards

- [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) (W3C)'s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an effort to improve the [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility) of the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) for people with [disabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability).
- Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) contributors create and maintain [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (WCAG) which is the global accessibility standard.
